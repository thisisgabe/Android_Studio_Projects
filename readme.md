Android Studio Project Files

This will be my collection of projects while learning Android development for my Mobile Development class.

Most, if not all, of these projects are written and created for educational purposes. They do not have the polish of a real end-user product.

## Code

All source code is free to use and view if needed.

## Motivation

Learn mobile development and practice using version control
